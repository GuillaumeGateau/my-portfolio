Detailed File Explanations

Components

	â€¢	ArticleCard.js:
	â€¢	Represents each article in the carousel.
	â€¢	Displays the article image and ensures padding for visual appeal.
	â€¢	Responsive design ensures images scale properly.
	â€¢	ArticleDrawer.js:
	â€¢	Opens as a modal/drawer to display detailed article content.
	â€¢	Includes the title, image, and body rendered from Markdown.
	â€¢	CSS adjusts layout for mobile vs. desktop.

Pages

	â€¢	Articles.js:
	â€¢	Main logic for fetching and rendering articles.
	â€¢	Includes the carousel and click handling for opening the drawer.
	â€¢	PasswordReset.js:
	â€¢	Handles user authentication and password recovery via Netlify Identity.

Styles

	â€¢	global.css:
	â€¢	Resets default browser styles.
	â€¢	Defines shared typography, colors, and utility classes.
	â€¢	Articles.css:
	â€¢	Defines the layout for the articles section.
	â€¢	Mobile-first styling ensures the carousel works well on small screens.
	â€¢	Desktop breakpoints adjust the card size and carousel layout.
	â€¢	Drawer.css:
	â€¢	Controls the look and feel of the ArticleDrawer.
	â€¢	Adjusts width, height, and padding based on screen size.

Utils

	â€¢	loadArticles.js:
	â€¢	Fetches articles from the CMS.
	â€¢	Parses Markdown content and metadata using gray-matter.
	â€¢	generatePostsJson.js:
	â€¢	Converts Markdown articles into a JSON format for Netlify to read during builds.

CSS Design

Mobile-First Approach

	â€¢	Default styles are optimized for mobile devices.
	â€¢	Breakpoints are added for larger screens using @media queries.

Breakpoints

/* Global breakpoints */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for tablets and above */
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  /* Styles for desktops and above */
}

Key Design Choices

	â€¢	Carousel:
	â€¢	Horizontally scrollable with overflow-x: auto.
	â€¢	No horizontal scroll for the page itselfâ€”only within the carousel.
	â€¢	Drawer:
	â€¢	Full-screen on mobile, fixed width on desktop.
	â€¢	Prevents background scrolling when open using overflow: hidden on the body.

How the Site Works

	1.	Articles Section:
	â€¢	Articles are loaded from Markdown files in the public/posts folder.
	â€¢	These are displayed as cards in a horizontally scrollable carousel.
	â€¢	Clicking a card opens the ArticleDrawer to view details.
	2.	Netlify CMS:
	â€¢	Accessible via /admin.
	â€¢	Allows easy creation and editing of articles using a simple UI.
	3.	Responsive Behavior:
	â€¢	The site adjusts dynamically based on screen size, ensuring a seamless experience on all devices.
