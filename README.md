Here is the expanded and highly detailed README with all the requested information. I have included deeper explanations, an enhanced project overview, directory breakdown, and expanded sections to ensure full clarity.

Portfolio Project - README

Project Overview

This portfolio project serves as a dynamic personal website showcasing articles, essays, professional work, and major career projects. Designed to be clean, responsive, and highly maintainable, the site uses Netlify CMS for content management, React for interactivity, and JSON automation scripts to dynamically pull and display data without manual configuration.

The site consists of several major sections:
	1.	Hero Section â€“ A sleek introduction to capture attention.
	2.	Articles Section â€“ Displays essays and projects in a modern carousel.
	3.	Resume Section â€“ A dynamic job history grid with interactive drawers for detailed project content.
	4.	CMS Integration â€“ Easy updates to content without touching the codebase.

Goals

1. Content Management
	â€¢	Articles: Markdown files stored in public/posts and managed via Netlify CMS.
	â€¢	Jobs: Job entries stored in public/jobs with associated projects nested dynamically.
	â€¢	Projects: Project Markdown files in public/projects are linked to jobs via jobId.

2. Dynamic Data Management
	â€¢	Automated JSON generation scripts to dynamically fetch articles, projects, and jobs into the frontend.
	â€¢	Content is displayed using structured data rather than static components.

3. Responsive and Engaging UI
	â€¢	Fully responsive design (mobile-first CSS).
	â€¢	Grid-based layout with interactive components for mobile, tablet, and desktop users.

Major Features

1. Articles Section
	â€¢	Articles are stored as Markdown files (public/posts) and include metadata like title, date, and image.
	â€¢	Articles are managed using Netlify CMS, enabling non-technical users to add, update, or delete content seamlessly.
	â€¢	A carousel component displays articles dynamically:
	â€¢	If an image is provided, it is shown in a clean card layout.
	â€¢	If no image is available, the article title is centered in the card.
	â€¢	Clicking a card opens a drawer modal to view detailed article content, including text rendered with React Markdown.

2. Resume and Job History Section
	â€¢	Resume Layout:
	â€¢	Jobs are displayed in a grid layout with a mobile-first approach.
	â€¢	Jobs are dynamically loaded from resumeData.json for scalability.
	â€¢	Interactive Job Modal:
	â€¢	Clicking a job tile opens a drawer that displays detailed job information and associated projects.
	â€¢	Projects are fetched dynamically using the mapProjectsToJobById utility.
	â€¢	Project Management:
	â€¢	Projects are stored as Markdown files (public/projects) and linked to jobs using a jobId.
	â€¢	Content includes titles, images, and detailed descriptions.

3. JSON Automation
	â€¢	Three key scripts ensure content is dynamically available:
	â€¢	generatePostsJson.js: Converts article Markdown files to posts.json.
	â€¢	generateProjectsJson.js: Maps project Markdown files to projects.json.
	â€¢	generateJobsMarkdown.js: Ensures job Markdown files are properly structured.
	â€¢	JSON files are consumed by React components for rendering.

4. CMS Integration
	â€¢	Netlify CMS provides an easy interface for managing content:
	â€¢	Accessible via /admin.
	â€¢	Supports articles, jobs, and projects with customizable forms.
	â€¢	CMS updates automatically trigger JSON generation and Netlify builds.
