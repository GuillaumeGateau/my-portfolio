Project Overview

This portfolio project serves as a personal website to showcase articles, essays, professional work, and major projects from your career. It is designed to dynamically manage content with a CMS and provide an engaging and professional experience to visitors. Key features include an articles section, a job history section with project details, and a responsive design to ensure usability across devices.

Goals
	1.	Content Management:
	â€¢	Allow easy creation and editing of articles, job entries, and projects using Netlify CMS.
	â€¢	Automate JSON generation for articles, projects, and jobs to integrate seamlessly into the frontend.
	2.	User Experience:
	â€¢	Showcase job history dynamically with projects nested under each job.
	â€¢	Enable interaction with job tiles that open detailed drawers to display associated projects.
	â€¢	Responsive and interactive UI that works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
	3.	Maintainability:
	â€¢	Use structured JSON files and Markdown for content, allowing scalable and easy updates.
	â€¢	Automate file generation through scripts for posts, jobs, and projects.

Major Features

	â€¢	Articles are stored as Markdown files in the public/posts directory.
	â€¢	Managed through Netlify CMS, allowing content updates without modifying code.
	â€¢	Articles are displayed in a scrollable carousel, with modals for detailed content.
	â€¢	JSON Automation:
	â€¢	A generatePostsJson.js script reads Markdown files and generates posts.json, enabling dynamic loading of articles in the app.

2. Job History Section
	â€¢	Job Tiles:
	â€¢	Displays a grid of jobs, dynamically mapped from resumeData.json.
	â€¢	Clicking on a tile opens a drawer modal to show details of the job, including associated projects.
	â€¢	Project Management:
	â€¢	Projects are stored as Markdown files in the public/projects directory.
	â€¢	Each project includes fields for a title, description, and jobId to associate it with a specific job.
	â€¢	The generateProjectsJson.js script converts project Markdown files into projects.json.
	â€¢	Nested Project Details:
	â€¢	In the drawer modal:
	â€¢	Projects are displayed as clickable tiles with their titles.
	â€¢	Clicking a tile opens detailed project content (e.g., descriptions and outcomes).
	â€¢	Job Management via Netlify CMS:
	â€¢	Jobs are managed in the public/jobs directory using Markdown files.
	â€¢	The generateJobsMarkdown.js script ensures all job entries are correctly formatted.

3. Dynamic JSON Integration
	â€¢	Automation Scripts:
	â€¢	generatePostsJson.js: Creates a posts.json file from articles.
	â€¢	generateProjectsJson.js: Creates a projects.json file from project Markdown files.
	â€¢	generateJobsMarkdown.js: Generates and updates job Markdown files in the public/jobs directory.
	â€¢	Mapping Projects to Jobs:
	â€¢	A utility function mapProjectsToJobById dynamically maps projects to their respective jobs by jobId, ensuring data is always up-to-date.
