#### The Problem

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the need for renters to find homes quickly while maintaining safety and minimizing face-to-face interactions. Traditional property tours were no longer feasible, and renters had to rely solely on online listings, which often provided limited and static information. Property managers lacked tools to augment listings with videos, 3D tours, or virtual live tours, leaving renters to make decisions based on incomplete data. At the same time, high demand meant properties were being leased rapidly, creating urgency for both renters and landlords to act efficiently. Existing systems lacked the infrastructure to support video uploads, 3D tours, or scheduling tools, making it nearly impossible to bridge the gap between renters and property managers in a contactless way.

#### The Solution

In response to the crisis, RentPath launched an internal system that enabled property managers to upload videos and links to 3D tours, empowering renters with more detailed and immersive property information. The system also introduced tools for scheduling self-guided and live virtual tours, ensuring a seamless process for both renters and landlords. This initiative required rapid development of new technology, partnerships with vendors like Matterport, and significant internal collaboration across engineering, design, business, and support teams.

Key features included a new property manager portal with Salesforce integration, secure authentication via magic links, and enhanced CDN capabilities to serve video content efficiently. On the renter side, the search results and property detail pages were redesigned to incorporate new CTAs for scheduling tours and accessing video content without disrupting the overall user experience.

#### Key Features

1. **Video and 3D Tour Uploads**

   * Property managers could upload videos directly or link to existing 3D tours from partners like Matterport.
   * Automated tools to extract and categorize data from video content, enhancing property listings.
2. **Secure and Intuitive Authentication**

   * Integration with Salesforce and internal databases for seamless data flow.
5. **Redesigned User Interfaces**

#### Key Results
