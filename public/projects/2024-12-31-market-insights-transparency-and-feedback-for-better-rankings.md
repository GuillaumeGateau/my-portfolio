#### The Problem

The shift to a ranking and relevance-based search algorithm, which considered factors like response rates, cancellation rates, acceptance rates, reviews, available amenities, and customer search criteria, created a more dynamic and fair marketplace. However, landlords struggled to understand why their properties were ranked as they were, leading to frequent complaints and frustration. The system’s complexity left landlords in the dark about how to improve their listings and compete effectively.

#### The Solution

Developed the "Market Insights" tool to provide landlords with actionable feedback on their listings’ rankings. By leveraging competitive sets, the tool gave landlords a relative score for each major feature compared to similar properties. Celebratory feedback highlighted their strengths, while actionable advice guided them on specific improvements to climb the rankings. For example, improving response times or adding amenities like microwaves (which increased bookings) could significantly boost their placement in search results. This transparency encouraged landlords to adopt best practices, ultimately improving the overall marketplace ecosystem.
