#### The Problem

While The RealReal enjoyed a consistent influx of consignments, not all supply was profitable. Lower-quality brands and lower-value items, though useful for driving traffic, incurred high operational costs throughout their lifecycle—from intake and authentication to photography, listing, and sale. The revenue generated from these items often didn’t cover the costs, impacting the company’s ability to achieve profitability.

The existing tiered commission structure applied a "peanut butter spread" approach, treating all items and consignors the same. This strategy:

1. **Failed to Incentivize the Right Behavior**:

   * High-value consignors and items didn’t receive appropriate rewards for their contributions.
   * Lower-value consignments drove operational inefficiencies without meaningful returns.
2. **Lacked Flexibility and Personalization**:

   * Commission rates didn’t reflect brand, item type, or quality differences, leaving money on the table for profitable items while subsidizing unprofitable ones.
3. **Customer Frustration**:

   * The static commission structure failed to align with consignor expectations for higher-value items, creating dissatisfaction and churn among key consignors.

#### The Solution

To address these challenges, we implemented a **Dynamic Commission Program** designed to:

1. **Incentivize High-Value Consignments**:

   * Reward consignors with higher payouts for items that align with The RealReal’s profitability goals.
   * Increase commissions for frequent consignors and higher-value items to drive loyalty and retention among profitable sellers.
2. **Disincentivize Unprofitable Supply**:

   * Adjust commissions downward for lower-value items and brands that drove inefficiencies without meaningful returns.
3. **Introduce Transparency**:

   * Provide consignors with clear, upfront visibility into their potential earnings through integration with the **Pack List for Consignors** and **Predicted Sale Price and Earnings** tools.

### Key Features and Implementation

#### 1. **Machine Learning Models and Financial Analysis**

* Developed ML models to predict:

  * Profitability of individual items based on brand, category, and attributes.
  * Commission elasticity, ensuring commission changes drove desired behaviors without alienating consignors.
* Conducted extensive financial modeling to balance commission incentives with operational costs and profit margins.

#### 2. **Dynamic Commission Calculation**

* Rebuilt the commission system to calculate rates dynamically based on:

  * Brand value and item attributes (e.g., luxury vs. mass-market).
  * Historical and predicted item performance.
  * Consignor behavior (e.g., frequency and total value of consignments).
* Integrated these calculations seamlessly into back-office (BoH) reporting and payout systems.

#### 3. **Enhanced Consignor Messaging**

* Designed clear and empathetic communication strategies to introduce the new commission structure without alienating consignors.
* Incorporated commission visibility into the front-end consignor experience, allowing them to:

  * See estimated commissions for their items before shipping.
  * Understand how commission rates were determined.

#### 4. **Loyalty Incentives**

* Rewarded consignors with increasing commission rates as they consigned more items or achieved higher cumulative sales (e.g., Influencer, Tastemaker, VIP tiers).

### Results

1. **Increased Profitability**:

   * Dynamic commissions aligned consignor behavior with the company’s profitability goals, improving margins across high-value categories.
2. **Improved Supply Quality**:

   * High-value consignors were incentivized to list more frequently, increasing the volume of desirable items.
3. **Reduced Operational Costs**:

   * Lower-value consignments decreased as consignors adjusted their behavior to align with the new structure.
4. **Enhanced Customer Retention**:

   * Higher-value consignors were retained and grew their activity due to increased payouts and transparency.
5. **Higher ROAS Potential**:

   * By achieving profitability with existing supply, the company was better positioned to reinvest in marketing, driving high-quality traffic and achieving a stronger return on ad spend (ROAS).

#### Why It Matters

The Dynamic Commission Program was a critical step in The RealReal’s journey to profitability. By aligning commissions with item value, brand goals, and consignor behavior, the initiative:

* Improved profitability across the board, ensuring the business could scale sustainably.
* Incentivized high-value consignors while disincentivizing unprofitable behaviors, leading to a more efficient supply chain.
* Enhanced transparency and trust with consignors, strengthening loyalty and retention.

This initiative demonstrated the power of data-driven decision-making to balance customer satisfaction with operational efficiency, positioning The RealReal as a more sustainable and scalable marketplace for luxury resale.
