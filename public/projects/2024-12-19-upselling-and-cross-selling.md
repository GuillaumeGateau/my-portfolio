Our research on customers buying online vs in store showed that employee upselling was generating a higher check. The customer shopping patterns showed that customers often struggle to find complementary or higher-value items that would complete their meal. As a result, many orders remain small and limited to a single product. This creates friction for customers who want a more indulgent combination of items but aren’t sure where to start.. The hypothesis is that by surfacing relevant recommendations—both complimentary add-ons (cross-sells) and higher-value options (upsells)—at the right moments, customers can quickly discover additional items that align with their meal goals, leading to increased engagement and higher average checks.

**Understanding Cross-Sells vs. Upsells**\
Cross-sells help customers complete their meals by suggesting items that naturally fit with what they’ve already chosen, such as biscuits or a dipping sauce alongside wings. Upsells introduce the possibility of stepping up to a larger portion, a more premium option, or a bundle that offers more value than the initial choice—ideal for those who are still deciding what would best satisfy them.

**Data-Driven Recommendations**\
The new recommendation and personalized prompts rely on collaborative filtering to present options based on actual customer behavior. On the product details page (PDP), these recommendations appear as “Recommended for You” items, making it clear what pairs well or is a good substitute with/for the current product. After a customer adds an item to the bag, a drawer appears, displaying the chosen item and suggesting an upsell drawn from patterns in browsing, clicking, adding, and purchasing habits. Instead of scrolling through a passive list of products, customers encounter a simple, contextually relevant choice—accept or decline a suggested addition—leading to a more intuitive and seamless experience.

**Impact**\
By integrating these targeted recommendations into the PDP and providing a well-timed, personalized prompt after adding items to the bag, customers more easily find what they need to round out or upgrade their meals. The result is an uptick in engagement, a higher average check, and an overall smoother, more helpful journey toward that spicy, crunchy, chicken.  Winner winner, chicken dinner!
