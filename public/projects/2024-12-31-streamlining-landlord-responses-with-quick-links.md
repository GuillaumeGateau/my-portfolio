#### The Problem

The marketplace suffered from slow response rates from landlords and outdated listings, which frustrated renters and reduced the platform's overall efficiency. Landlords often took too long to respond to inquiries, and many failed to promptly delist properties once rented, creating a poor user experience.

#### The Solution

Introduced dynamic quick links in email notifications to help landlords respond faster and keep listings updated. By analyzing thousands of email interactions, we identified that over 80% of questions and responses were repetitive, such as "Is this still available?" and "How much is the rent?" Quick-response buttons featuring these common landlord responses were added to emails, enabling landlords to reply instantly with pre-set answers or delist properties as needed.

#### Key Features

* Parsing email data to identify common questions and responses.
* Dynamic quick-response buttons embedded in landlord emails for instant replies.
* Automated delisting option for properties no longer available.
* Real-time updates to property status based on landlord interactions.

#### Key Results

* Increased response rates from landlords.
* Improved average response times, reducing listing-to-lease timelines.
* Enhanced renter satisfaction through faster and more accurate communication.
* Reduced the number of outdated listings.

#### Why It Matters

Streamlining communication between renters and landlords improves marketplace efficiency, ensures up-to-date listings, and enhances the experience for both parties. By automating common responses and actions, Zillow strengthened its role as a trusted, user-friendly platform.
