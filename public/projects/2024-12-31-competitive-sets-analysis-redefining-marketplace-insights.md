#### The Problem

Providing landlords with potential earnings, performance comparisons, and recommendations on rates and availability required identifying their true competitors. However, determining competitors was far more complex than comparing properties by size or location. Two houses next to each other could vary vastly in quality, amenities, or appeal. Additionally, proximity wasn’t always relevant—for example, on an island, a beachside property could compete more directly with another beachfront property on the opposite side of the island rather than a closer in-town listing. Factors like distance to bike trails, beach access points, and views significantly influenced competition. Availability and policies also played critical roles, as properties only competed when accessible during the same periods or under similar terms. Without accurate competitor sets, landlords lacked meaningful insights to make informed decisions, leading to dissatisfaction and missed opportunities.

#### The Solution

Developed an advanced competitive sets analysis system using clustering, collaborative filtering, and other cutting-edge algorithms to identify true competitors for each property. This system incorporated billions of data points, including implicit signals from search behavior. For instance, if users frequently viewed or clicked on two properties within the same search, this indicated a competitive relationship. By leveraging this data, Vrbo provided landlords with a list of competitors tailored to their property’s unique characteristics and market dynamics.

To address landlord concerns and enhance adoption, the system included transparency features. For every competitor, landlords could see detailed reasons for the match, such as proximity to key attractions, availability overlap, or amenity similarities. Recognizing that algorithms couldn’t capture every nuance, landlords were given the ability to add or remove competitors with mandatory feedback explaining their decision. This feedback created a human loop, feeding directly into the algorithm to improve accuracy over time.

#### Key Features

* Advanced algorithms like clustering and collaborative filtering to determine competitive sets.
* Use of implicit signals from user search and click behavior to identify competitors.
* Detailed explanations for each competitor, including specific shared attributes.
* Landlord-managed customization with the ability to add or remove competitors.
* Feedback loop integrating landlord insights into continuous algorithm improvement.

#### Key Results

* Revolutionized landlord insights with the first system to transparently identify and explain competitors.
* Increased landlord trust and engagement through detailed training and conference outreach.
* Improved adoption rates of related features like revenue management and ranking recommendations.
* Enhanced the accuracy of earnings estimates and performance comparisons.
* Established Vrbo as an industry leader with a one-of-a-kind competitive analysis system.

#### Why It Matters

The competitive sets analysis system fundamentally transformed how landlords interacted with Vrbo’s marketplace tools. By providing clear, actionable insights into their competition, landlords were empowered to optimize their properties and align with market demands. The ability to refine competitor sets ensured landlords’ expertise complemented algorithmic precision, fostering trust and collaboration. This innovation not only strengthened Vrbo’s position as a market leader but also elevated the overall quality and transparency of the marketplace, benefiting renters, landlords, and the platform alike.
