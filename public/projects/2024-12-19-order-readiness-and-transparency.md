**A More Transparent and Convenient Post-Order Experience**\
For many people, ordering food digitally is just the first step in getting a meal. After tapping “place order,” there’s often an uncomfortable waiting period filled with uncertainty. How long will it take? Should you head over now, or wait a bit longer? Our new Post-Order Experience initiative ensures that the moment you complete your order, you gain a clear understanding of when your food will be ready, along with continuous updates—no guesswork required.

**What is the Post-Order Experience?**\
We’ve designed a unified solution that guides you through every moment after placing your order. Instead of rushing to the restaurant too early or hanging around unsure of what’s happening, our enhanced approach provides real-time information to keep you confidently informed.

**Key Enhancements:**

1. **Immediate Time Estimates:**\
   Right after you’ve placed your order, you’ll see an estimated preparation time range—something like “Your order will be ready in 8-11 minutes.” We derive these estimates from historical data, typical meal preparation times, and known busy periods. By giving you a clear timeframe, you can plan your next steps without any guesswork.
2. **Real-Time Updates, Anywhere You Look:**

   * **In-App Visibility:** A persistent status bar appears at the top of your app. Even if you leave the order confirmation page, this bar travels with you through the app, always showing your order’s current status. If your wait time changes or your order moves from “being prepared” to “ready,” you’ll see it right there—no need to hunt for information.
   * **On Your Phone’s Lock Screen:** For supported devices, we tap into native system features that let you view order updates without re-opening the app. You can check your phone’s lock screen and see the order status and any changes at a glance. Think of it as your personal order tracker, always up to date, always at your fingertips.
3. **Actionable Information at the Right Time:**\
   Beyond timing, we also provide helpful instructions right when you need them. If you’ve ordered pickup, we’ll remind you how to quickly grab your meal once it’s ready. If there are any special pick-up instructions—like a designated area or a curbside zone—you’ll have that info handy when it matters.
4. **Follow-Up and Feedback:** After you receive your order, we’ll prompt you to share feedback. Was the timing accurate? Was the process smooth and transparent? By collecting feedback, we can continuously refine our estimates and experience. Your input helps us get better at delivering on our promise of easy, reliable, and satisfying food pickup.

**Why This Matters:**

* **More Control and Confidence:** Customers no longer have to guess or rely on gut instinct to figure out when to leave for the restaurant. With reliable time estimates and ongoing updates, planning your day around your meal becomes simple.
* **Less Stress, More Satisfaction:** We understand that waiting in uncertainty can be frustrating. By providing transparent, reliable information, you’ll feel assured and relaxed. This leads to a better overall experience and encourages you to return in the future.
* **Greater Convenience:** With notifications available at a glance—whether you’re in the app or just checking your lock screen—you stay informed even if you’re juggling other activities.

**A Better Experience from Start to Finish:**\
Our Post-Order Experience initiative is about treating the period after you’ve paid as an integral part of the customer journey. From accurate time estimates to continuous updates, guided instructions, and an easy channel for feedback, we’re making sure you get the most out of your digital ordering experience. It’s about transforming uncertainty into clarity, inconvenience into convenience, and a single transaction into a positive, seamless interaction.

In short, we’re not just delivering great food; we’re delivering peace of mind every step of the way. Enjoy knowing exactly when your meal will be ready—and that you’ll be kept in the loop until the moment you pick it up
