#### The Problem

Renters often struggled to narrow down their search results effectively, resulting in an overwhelming number of irrelevant properties and lower engagement with the platform. Existing subsetting tools were either underutilized or unintuitive, creating friction in the user journey. Renters needed a streamlined way to progressively refine results to create a manageable list of potential properties. Additionally, once filters were applied, the search results lacked dynamic updates, missing opportunities to surface relevant details as the renter honed their preferences. This not only frustrated users but also reduced the likelihood of renters connecting with property managers.

#### The Solution

Developed the "Guess Who" search narrowing feature, which introduced an intelligent and interactive subsetting experience. The feature dynamically adjusted content and filtering options as users refined their preferences, ensuring that the most relevant details were highlighted at every stage. This design mirrored the psychological process of elimination: as users selected specific criteria, irrelevant options were removed, and new, actionable data replaced redundant information.

Key innovations included dynamic search result cards, which adapted based on applied filters, and a rewarding, gamified experience to encourage renters to engage with subsetting tools. Inline filter cards were integrated to make filtering intuitive and accessible, driving renters to take deeper actions and ultimately improving lead quality for property managers.

#### Key Features

1. **Dynamic Search Result Cards**

   * Automatically updated content based on applied filters (e.g., removing irrelevant bedroom details after selecting a bedroom type).
   * Reallocated space on cards to showcase floorplan details, availability, or lifestyle-specific data as filters narrowed results.
2. **Inline Filter Cards**

   * Inserted directly into the search results, encouraging renters to refine results without navigating away from the page.
   * Increased filter engagement by surfacing intuitive options based on renter behavior.
3. **Gamified Subsetting**

   * Rewarding interactions, such as animations or visual cues, when users shortlisted or dismissed properties.
   * Designed to give renters a sense of progress and accomplishment as they refined their searches.
4. **Actionable Insights on Search Cards**

   * Highlighted key dynamic data points, such as commute times, school rankings, and pet policies, based on the renter’s selected filters.
   * Supported up to four dynamic data fields, updating in real-time as new filters were applied.

#### Key Results

* **Higher Filter Engagement**: Inline filter cards led to a 61% increase in sessions where renters applied filters, compared to traditional header-based filter tools.
* **Improved Conversion Rates**: Renters who applied inline filters converted 7.7% higher than those who used traditional filters.
* **Enhanced Lead Quality**: Renters who progressed through subsetting provided better-qualified leads for property managers.
* **Increased Property Engagement**: Dynamic search cards and actionable insights improved interactions with listings and reduced abandonment rates.

#### Why It Matters

The "Guess Who" search narrowing and subsetting feature transformed the renter experience by providing an intuitive, dynamic, and rewarding way to refine search results. By reducing friction and creating actionable insights at every step, we not only improved renter satisfaction but also delivered higher-quality leads to property managers. This approach set a new standard for search refinement in the rental marketplace, bridging the gap between user preferences and actionable outcomes for stakeholders.
