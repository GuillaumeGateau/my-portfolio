Building a cohesive, omni-channel personalization strategy requires a centralized approach that leverages a Customer Data Platform (CDP) and focuses on identity resolution, integrations, real-time data, and AI-driven recommendations. By first running and finalizing an RFP for a robust CDP, the foundation is set to unify customer insights and enable targeted, data-driven marketing efforts.

**Objective**\
Establish an end-to-end personalization framework spanning advertising, performance media, social media, CRM, identity management, and push notifications. The goal is to improve Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), conversion, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by ensuring customers consistently receive relevant, timely messages and offers aligned with their preferences.

**Strategy Overview**\
The strategy centers on a single personalization engine that aggregates first-party data, purchase history, and external signals. It uses rules-based and machine learning models (including collaborative filtering and predictive analytics) to produce meaningful “Recommended for You” experiences and serve dynamic offers. Contextual factors like location or time of day enhance this relevance. By integrating seamlessly with each marketing channel—whether that’s tailored advertising, targeted emails, or push notifications—customers encounter consistent, value-added suggestions throughout their journey.

**Key Components**

* **CDP Integration:** A unified repository for first-party, behavioral, and demographic data.
* **Personalization Engine:** Combines rules-based logic and machine learning models to deliver custom recommendations and offers.
* **Omni-Channel Delivery:** APIs and integrations power real-time, channel-appropriate content across ads, CRM, social, and on-site experiences.
* **Offer Management:** Dynamically generated promotions and discounts informed by past engagement and predictive modeling.
* **Measurement & Optimization:** Continuous A/B testing, attribution analysis, and feedback loops refine targeting, maximize ROAS, and drive incremental gains in conversion and CLV.
