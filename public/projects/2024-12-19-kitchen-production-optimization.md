**Precision Cooking Through Data-Driven Forecasting and Task-Based Guidance**\
In a bustling restaurant kitchen, timing and inventory management are everything. Customers expect their meals fast and fresh, while operators aim to minimize waste and avoid stockouts. Striking the right balance can be daunting. Our solution combines advanced forecasting models with user-friendly, touchscreen interfaces to guide kitchen staff and managers, ensuring the right amount of each protein is cooked at the right time.

**The Challenge: Balancing Freshness, Speed, and Waste Reduction**\
Traditionally, predicting how much chicken, tenders, or wings to prepare at any given hour relied on guesswork, experience, and static printed charts. This approach often led to one of two outcomes: too much product cooked early (waste, as it sits too long) or too little prepared (leading to out-of-stock situations and longer wait times). Managing these complexities is crucial for maintaining product quality and speed of service.

**The Data-Driven Approach: Forecasting Future Demand**\
We’ve developed a forecasting pipeline that uses a Light Gradient Boosting model to predict hourly protein needs at each restaurant. This model harnesses a variety of signals:

* **Sales History:** Past sales data at the national, regional, and restaurant level.
* **External Factors:** Day of the week, weather conditions, local events, and holidays.
* **Restaurant-Specific Attributes:** Known busy periods, operational constraints, and equipment limitations.

By blending these inputs, we generate a robust hourly forecast that approximates how much of each protein type (e.g., classic chicken, spicy wings, tenders) will be needed.

**From Forecast to Action: Task-Based Drop Charts**\
Raw data forecasts alone don’t solve the problem—kitchen staff need actionable guidance. That’s where our intuitive touchscreen interface comes in. Instead of handing cooks a long list of totals for the entire hour, the system breaks down the forecast into manageable, incremental tasks or “cards.” For example, if the forecast calls for 100 wings in an hour, the screen might show ten cards of 10 wings each spread throughout the hour.

Key features of the task-based approach:

1. **Discrete, Manageable Batches:** Rather than cooking all 100 wings at once, the system staggers the tasks over the hour. This prevents overproduction early on and keeps items fresh.
2. **Dynamic Prioritization:** Cards are interleaved so no single protein is overemphasized at the start of the hour. As certain proteins run low, priority can shift dynamically, signaling cooks to focus on what’s critical.
3. **Visual Feedback and States:** Each card goes through states like default (to be cooked), cooking (with a timer), completed, or priority (if it needs to be pushed to the front of the line). This reduces mental math and guesswork, enabling cooks to focus on execution.

**Two-Way Communication: On the Line and Protein Views**\
We’ve recognized that both cooks and frontline staff (who request more product) need transparency. The system offers multiple synchronized views:

* **Protein View (For Fry Cooks):** Shows the discrete drop tasks. Once a cook taps on a task to start cooking, a timer appears, and upon completion, the task turns green. This gives an at-a-glance understanding of what’s cooking now, what’s coming next, and what’s done.
* **On-the-Line View (For Line Workers):** Displays what’s been completed, what’s currently cooking, and what’s scheduled next. If line workers notice something running out, they can request more. This reduces chaos and unnecessary communication overhead—both views share a common source of truth.

**Manager Oversight: Adjusting the Forecast On the Fly**\
While the model is powerful, managers may have local insights—unexpected catering orders, special events, or staffing shortages—that the forecast can’t predict. A manager view allows them to review the entire day’s forecast, make adjustments, and override certain projections if needed. This control:

* Restores trust when managers see discrepancies.
* Empowers managers to handle anomalies that the model cannot foresee.
* Encourages manager buy-in and thus team adherence to the recommended tasks.

By monitoring usage, comparing forecast accuracy, and observing adjustments, managers become active participants in refining the process. Over time, this leads to better alignment between prediction and reality.

**Continuous Improvement Through Feedback Loops**\
The system isn’t static. Data on actual sales versus forecasted amounts, cook taps, and on-the-line requests feed back into the model. The more the team uses the tool, the better it becomes at predicting demand. Additionally, managers’ edits serve as valuable signals for future model refinements. As usage grows, the pipeline becomes more robust, delivering ever more accurate forecasts and reducing both wait times and waste.

**Key Benefits:**

1. **Speed of Service:** By having a steady flow of freshly cooked product, customers receive their orders faster.
2. **Product Freshness:** Staggered cooking keeps items from sitting too long under heat lamps, improving food quality.
3. **Waste Reduction:** Data-driven forecasting and incremental production limit overcooking and spoilage.
4. **Operational Ease:** With a “don’t make me think” approach, cooks and line workers can trust the system’s guidance, reducing stress and errors.
5. **Managerial Control & Accountability:** Managers can tweak forecasts and track usage, building trust in the system and ensuring teams follow best practices.

**Conclusion: Transforming Kitchen Operations with Data and Design**\
Our integrated forecasting and task-based cooking solution fundamentally changes how kitchens produce and manage protein inventory. By blending advanced machine learning with intuitive UX design, we’ve made it easier for cooks to follow recommendations, for line workers to know what’s coming, and for managers to refine the process in real-time. The result is a more efficient, responsive kitchen operation that satisfies customers, conserves resources, and sets the stage for continuous innovation and improvement.
