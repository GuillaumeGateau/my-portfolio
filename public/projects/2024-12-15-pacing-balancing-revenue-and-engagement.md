### **The Challenge: Maximizing Revenue Without Losing Client Trust**

When I joined Zillow Rentals, the revenue model was simple: we sold leads to property owners, and each client had a monthly budget or “cap.” If we over-delivered on leads, those extra leads came out of our pocket, cutting into profits. If we under-delivered, the leftover budget evaporated, and we lost potential revenue.

The problem wasn’t just theoretical—it was happening every month. Clients in high-demand areas were consistently over-delivered, while others fell short. With budgets resetting at the end of the month, any missed opportunity was gone for good. My goal was clear: reduce over-deliveries, meet client caps, and do it all while maintaining a great experience for renters and landlords.

### **The Problem: Quality vs Quantity**

One of the biggest challenges I faced was balancing revenue goals with maintaining the integrity of our search results. Some buildings are just always in demand—no matter how carefully we ranked or ordered listings, people gravitated toward the same properties. Penalizing these high-performing buildings by pushing them down the rankings didn’t feel right, but I also couldn’t ignore the revenue hit from over-delivering on their leads.

On the flip side, low-demand areas or properties posed a different problem. If inventory appeared stale or irrelevant, renters disengaged, and clients saw less value in paying for leads. Balancing these extremes required a smarter approach to both lead delivery and the way we displayed listings.

### **Reframing the Problem: The Newsboy Analogy**

I started thinking of the problem like the “Newsboy Problem” from game theory. Just like a newsboy needs to predict how many papers to stock, Zillow had to balance supply and demand with limited information. Leads were perishable—once the month ended, under-delivered caps couldn’t be rolled over, and over-delivered leads couldn’t be clawed back.

Here’s how I broke it down:

1. **Capacity Constraint:** Most clicks came from the first 25 listings on a page, so placement was critical. We needed to make sure the right properties were seen at the right time.
2. **Demand Constraint:** In some areas, there were more listings than renters searching. Showing irrelevant listings wasted impressions and hurt engagement.
3. **Shortage Costs:** Under-delivering on leads hurt our reputation and left money on the table, while over-delivering drained revenue unnecessarily.
4. **Diversity and Substitution:** Renters need options to feel in control. A mix of property types (single-family homes, multi-family apartments, condos, etc.) not only kept them engaged but also prevented popular properties from cannibalizing leads from others.

### **My Approach**

To tackle these challenges, I focused on smarter ranking, real-time adjustments, and better client relationships.

* **Popularity Scoring:** I created a system that ensured a mix of high-performing and less competitive listings on every page. This kept renters engaged and gave lower-demand properties a fair shot.
* **Dynamic Allocation:** By tracking demand in real time, I could prioritize lead delivery for clients nearing their caps while slowing delivery for over-performing ones.
* **Upselling High-Demand Clients:** For clients consistently over-delivered, I developed strategies to upsell additional leads, turning excess demand into revenue instead of a sunk cost.
* **Balancing Engagement:** I made sure renters always saw diverse, relevant listings, which boosted user satisfaction and helped us retain clients in lower-demand regions.

### **The Results**

This approach transformed how we managed leads and revenue.

* **Reduced Over-Delivery:** High-demand clients saw fewer excess leads, and we captured more value from their budgets.
* **Higher Cap Fulfillment:** Clients in under-performing regions hit their lead targets more consistently.
* **Increased Engagement:** Renters interacted with more listings per session, and clients in low-demand areas gained more traction.

Balancing revenue goals with client satisfaction isn’t easy, but the changes I implemented made a real difference. By thinking creatively, analyzing the data, and keeping renters’ and landlords’ needs at the center, I was able to deliver better outcomes for everyone involved.
