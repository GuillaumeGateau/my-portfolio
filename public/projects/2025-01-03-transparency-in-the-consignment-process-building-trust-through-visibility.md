#### The Problem

The RealReal’s consignors often sent in high-value luxury goods but lacked visibility into where their items were in the consignment process. This created several challenges:

1. **Uncertainty and Frustration**:

   * Consignors had no clear timeline for when items would be processed, authenticated, listed, or sold.
   * They were unaware of critical details such as quality ratings, pricing decisions, and storage locations.
2. **High Support Costs**:

   * Consignors frequently contacted support teams to inquire about their items, driving up operational costs.
3. **Trust Erosion**:

   * Lack of transparency created anxiety and led some consignors to request their items back prematurely, increasing shipping costs and reducing potential sales.

#### The Solution

To address these pain points, we developed a comprehensive transparency system that provided real-time updates on the status of each item throughout the consignment process. By offering detailed, step-by-step visibility, consignors gained confidence and trust in The RealReal’s handling of their goods.

### Key Features and Implementation

#### 1. **Real-Time Status Updates**

* Consignors received notifications for every key milestone, including:

  * **Receipt:** Confirming the item’s arrival at The RealReal.
  * **Authentication:** Detailing the results of the authentication process.
  * **Quality Assessment:** Sharing the condition rating assigned to the item.
  * **Photography:** Indicating when professional images were captured.
  * **Listing:** Providing the price and details of the item once it was live on the site.

#### 2. **Detailed Item Information**

* Consignors could view:

  * **Quality Ratings:** Clear explanations of how quality was assessed.
  * **Professional Photos:** High-resolution images of their items, ensuring transparency in presentation.
  * **Pricing Decisions:** Insights into how the price was determined based on market trends and item condition.
  * **Storage Details:** Where the item was stored until it was sold.

#### 3. **Post-Sale Updates**

* Once an item sold, consignors were updated on:

  * **Shipment Status:** When the item was shipped to the buyer.
  * **Returns:** Notifications if the item was returned.
  * **Payout Timing:** Clear timelines for when they would receive payment.

#### 4. **Integrated Dashboard**

* Developed a user-friendly dashboard consolidating all item details and statuses in one place.
* Added predictive timelines for each stage based on historical processing data, helping consignors manage expectations.

### Results

1. **Increased Consignor Trust and Satisfaction**:

   * Transparency built confidence in The RealReal’s process, leading to higher Net Promoter Scores (NPS).
2. **Reduced Support Costs**:

   * A significant drop in consignor inquiries reduced the burden on support teams.
3. **Lower Return Requests**:

   * Fewer consignors requested items back prematurely, reducing shipping costs and improving inventory stability.
4. **Stronger Retention and Supply Growth**:

   * Consignors felt more secure, leading to higher retention rates and increased supply volume.

#### Why It Matters

This transparency initiative addressed one of the most critical barriers to trust in the consignment process. By providing consignors with real-time updates and detailed insights into each stage of their items’ journey, we:

* Reinforced The RealReal’s reputation as a reliable and customer-focused platform.
* Improved operational efficiency by reducing support inquiries and return requests.
* Enhanced consignor loyalty and drove supply growth, creating a more robust and scalable marketplace.

Transparency isn’t just a feature; it’s a cornerstone of trust. By giving consignors visibility and control, we strengthened their confidence in The RealReal and positioned the platform as a leader in luxury resale.
