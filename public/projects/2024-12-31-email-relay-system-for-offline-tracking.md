#### The Problem

At the time, as soon as someone contacted a landlord, communication moved to email, leaving Zillow unable to track if the renter and landlord met, saw the property, or completed a rental agreement. This lack of visibility created safety concerns for renters and led to incomplete user journey data. Additionally, Zillow had no mechanism to measure the responsiveness of landlords or ensure positive marketplace behavior.

#### The Solution

Developed an email relay system that leveraged hashed, temporary email addresses to facilitate and monitor communication between landlords and renters. Emails were intercepted, stored, and returned to the intended recipient, enabling Zillow to analyze communication patterns and deduce key outcomes like meeting confirmations. This system also incentivized good behavior through response tracking and proactive management of underperforming landlords.

#### Key Features

* Temporary hashed email addresses to mediate communication.
* Tools to analyze email threads and deduce meeting outcomes.
* Real-time metrics on landlord and renter responsiveness.
* Automated alerts for landlords with low response rates, including delisting warnings.

#### Key Results

* Increased visibility into renter-landlord interactions.
* Improved response times among landlords, boosting marketplace trust.
* Enhanced safety and accountability in the rental process.
* Strengthened marketplace behavior through built-in incentives.

#### Why It Matters

Bridging offline and online interactions provided a safer, more transparent rental experience while improving landlord accountability and renter satisfaction. Leveraging an industry-standard email relay system ensured these enhancements were both effective and scalable, contributing to a more trustworthy and efficient marketplace.
