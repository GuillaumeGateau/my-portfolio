#### The Problem

Renters often faced a fragmented search experience when exploring properties. While search results pages (SRPs) provided a diverse selection of listings, the journey often ended in frustration when users clicked on a property detail page (PDP) and found it wasn’t the right fit. Historically, renters would have to click back to the SRP, losing valuable context and starting over with a static set of results. This back-and-forth navigation ignored key signals from the renter’s interactions, such as which property features caught their attention. Moreover, existing carousels on PDPs were limited, typically showing properties too similar to the current listing without leveraging implicit signals from user behavior to diversify and refine recommendations.

#### The Solution

RentPath transformed the renter journey by introducing a dynamic PDP-to-PDP navigation system that leveraged both explicit and implicit user signals. The system analyzed renters’ interactions—such as clicks, dwell time, and comparisons—to refine recommendations in real-time and create a seamless progression of properties. Instead of forcing users back to static SRPs, this system presented multiple carousels within PDPs, each offering a diverse selection of properties tailored to the renter’s evolving preferences. By continuously learning from interactions, the system dynamically updated recommendations, effectively guiding renters through a "rabbit hole" of increasingly relevant options.

#### Key Features

1. **Dynamic Property Recommendations**

   * Multiple carousels on PDPs showcasing diverse properties with varied facets (e.g., location, price, amenities).
   * Real-time updates based on user clicks and comparisons to highlight both similarities and differences between properties.
2. **Implicit Signal Integration**

   * Used behavioral data like dwell time, click paths, and skipped properties to infer renter preferences.
   * Prioritized properties that balanced user interest with diversity to refine search results effectively.
3. **Enhanced Search Journey**

   * Eliminated the need to return to SRPs by seamlessly guiding users through PDPs tailored to their evolving preferences.
   * Allowed renters to explore properties iteratively, fine-tuning results with each interaction.
4. **Dynamic Carousel Design**

   * Showcased properties with varied facets to address potential decision-making factors (e.g., size, amenities, views).
   * Continuously refined carousels to focus on key similarities and introduce subtle differences to aid the decision process.
5. **Iterative Learning and Updates**

   * Leveraged aggregated user behavior data to improve recommendation algorithms.
   * Dynamically updated carousels to reflect emerging preferences, ensuring relevance at every stage of the journey.

#### Key Results

* **Increased Engagement**: Renters viewed more properties per session, deepening their exploration and reducing drop-off rates.
* **Improved Match Quality**: Enhanced recommendations led to faster contact rates with property managers and higher conversion rates.
* **Accelerated Leasing Decisions**: By refining property options dynamically, renters were more likely to find and lease properties in less time.
* **Higher Renter Satisfaction**: The seamless and intuitive journey empowered renters to make confident decisions.

#### Why It Matters

The PDP-to-PDP navigation system revolutionized how renters explored properties by turning a traditionally static and linear process into a dynamic, user-centered journey. By leveraging implicit signals and real-time updates, RentPath created a highly personalized experience that significantly improved outcomes for renters and property managers alike. This innovation exemplified RentPath’s commitment to understanding user behavior and delivering cutting-edge solutions to enhance the rental search journey.
