## **The Problem: A Broken Rental Process**

Renting is often inefficient and frustrating for both landlords and renters. Landlords face an overwhelming influx of low-quality leads, often lacking critical information to evaluate tenants. Responding to prospects required sifting through incomplete emails, leading to frustration and missed opportunities. Renters, on the other hand, struggled to stand out or get timely responses, often facing long, back-and-forth email chains before securing a tour.

Zillow Rentals, with 10 million monthly users, saw significant engagement in searches and initial contacts, but landlords’ response rates hovered around 15%, and renters frequently contacted only one property before leaving the platform. The rental process was broken, and Zillow needed to fix it.

## **The Solution: Renter Profile**

To bridge this gap, we created the **Renter Profile**—a tool designed to streamline communication, provide landlords with key decision-making information, and help renters showcase their qualifications upfront.

## Key features of the Renter Profile:

* **Comprehensive Tenant Information:** Income, credit score, rental preferences, pet ownership, and more—making it easier for landlords to evaluate prospects quickly.
* **Simplified Onboarding:** Gamified steps encouraged renters to complete their profiles fully.
* **Streamlined Lead Management:** Profiles provided landlords with detailed, standardized information, reducing the back-and-forth needed to set up tours.

The Renter Profile aimed to eliminate inefficiencies, increase engagement, and create a more seamless rental experience.

## **Key Results**

The Renter Profile’s launch delivered immediate and transformative results:

* **1.2M Profiles Created in Two Months:** With a 70% average completion rate across 21 profile questions.
* **Improved Lead Quality:** High-quality leads (HQL) rose to 65%, giving landlords more actionable insights.
* **Faster Time-to-Tour (TTT):** Emails required to schedule a tour dropped from 10+ to 3 for high-fill-rate profiles, improving efficiency by 3x.
* **Higher Response Rates (RR):** Doubled to 30% after launch and climbed to 50% after highlighting profile completion percentages in email subject lines.
* **Increased Renter Engagement:** Contacts per renter (CPR) grew from 1.6 to over 3, and one-and-done users fell from 70% to 30%.

## **Why It Matters**

The Renter Profile solved critical pain points in the rental journey:

* For landlords, it delivered higher-quality leads with less effort, enabling faster and more informed decisions.
* For renters, it increased visibility and reduced the time needed to secure a tour, improving their chances of finding a home.

By addressing these inefficiencies, the Renter Profile transformed Zillow Rentals into a more effective and user-friendly platform, setting a new standard for engagement and communication in the rental market.
