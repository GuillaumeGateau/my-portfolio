#### The Problem

Many prospective landlords hesitated to list their properties on Vrbo due to uncertainty about how much they could earn or whether it would cover expenses like mortgages. Additionally, landlords often undervalued their listings or lacked the data needed to make informed pricing decisions. This hesitation negatively impacted Vrbo by hindering the growth of the supply side of the marketplace.

#### The Solution

Developed a tool to provide personalized earning estimates for landlords based on property characteristics, market trends, and historical data. To ensure accuracy, landlords entered details about their property, such as location and size. Using competitive set data, historical earnings, and market trends, the tool generated a forecast based on the median value to avoid overselling the platform. This process built confidence in the platform and encouraged landlords to sign up.

#### Key Features

* Dynamic earning estimates tailored to property details and location.
* Integration with competitive set data, market trends, and historical performance.
* User-friendly interface guiding landlords through the listing process.

#### Key Results

* Increased the number of new property listings.
* Improved conversion rates for prospective landlords signing up on the platform.
* Enhanced trust and engagement with Vrbo’s tools and resources.
* Boosted retention and Net Promoter Score (NPS) among vacation rental owners by delivering on earning estimates.

#### Why It Matters

Providing landlords with clear earning potential builds trust and lowers barriers to entry, driving growth in Vrbo’s inventory and ensuring a competitive marketplace for renters and property owners alike. Additionally, accurate forecasts strengthened trust in the platform, encouraging landlords to prioritize bookings through Vrbo over other platforms.
