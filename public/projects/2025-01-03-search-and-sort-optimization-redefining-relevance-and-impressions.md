#### The Problem

The RealReal’s search and sort system operated on static rules that prioritized newness, displaying the most recently listed items at the top of search results. This approach failed to consider customer preferences or item performance metrics, creating a host of problems:

1. **Overemphasis on Newness**:

   * Newly listed items dominated the top of search results and sold quickly due to visibility, not desirability.
   * Desirable items that weren’t purchased immediately were buried as newer items entered the system, limiting their exposure.
2. **Missed Customer Signals**:

   * Customer interactions such as clicks, favorites, and add-to-bag actions were not factored into rankings.
   * Impression-level data was ignored, leaving no insights into which items were seen but not clicked or purchased.
3. **Irrelevance in Search Results**:

   * Overly rigid hierarchies prioritized attributes like brand over more relevant categories, leading to mismatched results (e.g., prioritizing a specific brand’s tote bag over the entire tote bag category).
   * Autocomplete search terms further exacerbated this issue by restricting diversity in results.

#### The Solution

To address these challenges, we overhauled the search and sort system, introducing a dynamic, data-driven approach based on customer behavior. Central to this transformation was the introduction of the **Desirability Index**, which calculated an item’s appeal based on real-time interactions and impression-level data.

### Key Features and Changes

#### 1. **Desirability Index**

The Desirability Index became the cornerstone of the new ranking system, leveraging:

* **Impressions-to-Click Rate (CTR):** Measuring how often an item was viewed versus clicked.
* **Favorites:** Tracking how many customers added an item to their wish lists.
* **Add-to-Bag Actions:** Monitoring items placed in carts but not purchased.
* **Purchases:** Incorporating the speed and frequency of sales to identify truly desirable items.

By incorporating impression-level data, we gained insights into items that were frequently viewed but not clicked, revealing potential mismatches in pricing, quality, or relevance.

#### 2. **Dynamic Ranking**

We replaced the static time-based sorting with a dynamic system that prioritized customer interactions:

* Items were ranked based on their Desirability Index, ensuring that high-performing items remained visible longer.
* Rotational exposure ensured that new items received adequate impressions before being ranked lower, allowing the system to accurately evaluate their desirability.

#### 3. **Flexible Hierarchies and Search Logic**

We updated the search algorithm to:

* Loosen rigid hierarchies, ensuring that diverse results were shown for broad queries (e.g., displaying all tote bags rather than over-prioritizing a specific brand).
* Adjust autocomplete logic to account for more nuanced customer intents, avoiding irrelevant or overly narrow results.

#### Results

1. **Increased Engagement**:

   * Customers spent more time interacting with relevant results, leading to higher click-through rates and add-to-bag actions.
2. **Improved Conversion Rates**:

   * Customers found desirable items more quickly, resulting in faster purchase decisions.
3. **Enhanced Transparency for Consignors**:

   * Consignors gained visibility into how items were performing in search rankings, building trust and improving retention.

#### Why It Matters

The transformation of The RealReal’s search and sort system fundamentally reshaped how customers interacted with the platform. By aligning item rankings with customer behavior, we:

* Delivered more relevant results, ensuring customers found desirable items faster.
* Built trust with consignors by providing transparency into how their items performed in search rankings.
* Increased customer engagement and satisfaction, driving higher conversion rates and improving overall marketplace efficiency.
