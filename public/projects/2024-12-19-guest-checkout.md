**Breaking Down Barriers: Guest Checkout**

Imagine walking into a restaurant, selecting a few items at the counter, and then being asked to share your personal details before you can see the total or change your order. It’s a jarring request—one that would likely send many customers straight out the door. Yet, in our digital experience, that’s essentially what we were doing: before guests could even review their bag, they had to create an account. The friction this caused was significant, leading to fewer completed purchases and missed opportunities.

**The Problem**\
Before implementing guest checkout, our digital ordering experience required customers to sign in or sign up just to view their order details. While account creation can be valuable for loyalty and marketing, making it mandatory at such an early stage added unwanted complexity. Customers who simply wanted a quick, hassle-free meal were often deterred, lowering our conversion and total digital sales.

**The Hypothesis**\
We believed that offering a guest checkout option—allowing customers to see their order and proceed without personal sign-in—would increase conversion. By removing the upfront identity requirement, more people would follow through to purchase. In short, if we treated digital ordering more like a typical in-restaurant scenario, customers would feel more comfortable, valued, and in control.

**Our Approach**\
We redesigned the checkout process to give unauthenticated users immediate access to their bag. Now, they can review items, adjust quantities, and view pricing details, all without entering personal information. Payment options were moved directly onto the same page, eliminating extra steps and making the overall experience feel more like a real-life interaction: simple, direct, and respectful of a guest’s time and privacy.

**What We Learned**\
Early results show a clear improvement in the conversion rate among guest shoppers. More people complete their orders, thanks to the reduced friction. Interestingly, the shift also changed how customers pay: with multiple payment methods displayed upfront, more users gravitated toward certain digital wallets rather than traditional credit cards. The streamlined approach appealed to those who value speed and convenience.

On the other hand, not forcing enrollment had some trade-offs. Fewer people created accounts upfront, which means we can’t rely on mandatory sign-ups to bolster our loyalty and CRM databases. But this shift challenges us to think differently about long-term customer relationships. Instead of compelling users to join before their first order, we now have to truly “sell” the benefits of membership. We can highlight faster reordering, personalized offers, and exclusive rewards—making the loyalty program feel like a thoughtful, beneficial choice rather than a barrier to completing a purchase.

**Moving Forward**\
Guest checkout is part of a broader effort to respect customer privacy, reduce friction, and boost overall sales. By providing an experience that mirrors the simplicity of ordering at the counter, we’re building trust and encouraging customers to return. This change also sets the stage for future optimizations. For example, we can experiment with different ways to highlight loyalty perks post-purchase, or better leverage marketing tools to re-engage guest shoppers who enjoyed the frictionless experience.

In essence, we’ve learned that offering people the freedom to buy without conditions can ultimately create a more positive, lasting impression. Customers appreciate choice, and when they see that their needs and convenience come first, they’re more likely to reward us with their ongoing business. As we continue to refine and iterate, our aim is to keep making it easy for customers to enjoy what they came for—great food—no strings attached.
