#### The Problem

The RealReal’s customers often leveraged the predictable discounting patterns to delay purchases, particularly by saving items and waiting for price reductions. While this strategy worked for buyers aiming for bargains, it led to:

1. **Missed Opportunities for Serious Buyers**:

   * Customers who genuinely valued an item often hesitated, hoping for a discount, only to be disappointed when it sold to someone else.
2. **Devalued Items and Delayed Sales**:

   * Buyers perceived items as less urgent or exclusive, further reinforcing the habit of waiting.
3. **Impact on Consignors and Margins**:

   * Lower prices eroded consignor trust and reduced supply growth.
   * Predictable pricing patterns hurt margins, as items sold primarily at discounts rather than full price.

#### The Solution

We introduced transparency around demand by surfacing **like counts** (saved item totals) directly on the Product Detail Page (PDP), in the shopping bag, and within customers’ saved items list. This visibility created a sense of urgency, showing buyers how many others were interested in the same item, which:

* Encouraged customers to act sooner, fearing the item might sell out.
* Prioritized sales to those who valued the item most, rather than those waiting for a discount.
* Improved overall sales velocity and margins, benefiting both The RealReal and consignors.

### Key Features and Implementation

#### 1. **Visible Like Counts**

* Displayed the total number of likes on:

  * The Product Detail Page (PDP): Reinforcing urgency at the point of decision.
  * Shopping Bag: Reminding customers that others were interested in items they’d saved.
  * Saved Items: Highlighting competition for items in wish lists.

#### 2. **Behavioral Insights Integration**

* Incorporated like counts into the **Desirability Index**, linking high-interest items with faster sales.
* Tracked the correlation between like counts and conversion rates to continuously refine messaging.

#### 3. **Consistent Messaging Across Channels**

* Added subtle but effective prompts, such as “10 others have saved this item” or “High interest: Likely to sell soon” on PDPs.
* Designed unobtrusive but noticeable indicators to avoid overwhelming the shopping experience.

#### Results

1. **Higher Conversion Rates**:

   * Customers acted faster to secure items, significantly reducing the time to sale.
2. **Increased Average Sale Prices**:

   * Buyers purchased at higher prices, reducing dependency on discounts.
3. **Improved Consignor Retention**:

   * Higher prices and faster sales boosted consignor trust and encouraged repeat listings.
4. **Enhanced Customer Satisfaction**:

   * Buyers appreciated the transparency, reducing disappointment from missed items.
5. **Better Supply Growth**:

   * Consignors were motivated by the higher returns, resulting in increased supply and improved NPS (Net Promoter Score).

#### Why It Matters

This initiative fundamentally shifted buyer behavior by creating urgency through transparency. By showing customers how many others were interested in an item, we:

* Reduced delayed purchases and increased sales velocity.
* Enhanced margins and consignor satisfaction, addressing two of the marketplace’s biggest challenges: supply and pricing.
* Reinforced The RealReal’s value proposition as a trusted and efficient luxury resale platform, ensuring both buyers and consignors benefited from a more dynamic and equitable marketplace.
