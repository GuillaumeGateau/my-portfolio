#### The Problem

The RealReal’s consignment process required consignors to send their items to our facilities for authentication, photography, and listing. While consignors valued the convenience, many struggled with the logistics of preparing and shipping their items. Common issues included:

1. **Inefficiencies in Item Preparation**:

   * Consignors often forgot required information, such as item details or provenance documentation.
   * Items were improperly packed, leading to potential damage during transit.
2. **Operational Delays**:

   * Missing or incomplete information slowed down processing times once items arrived at our facilities.
3. **Loss and Accountability**:

   * Without clear documentation of the items sent, disputes occasionally arose about what was included in a shipment.
4. **Consignor Frustration**:

   * The lack of clarity in the process created a subpar experience, discouraging consignors from listing additional items.

#### The Solution

To address these issues, we introduced a **Dynamic Pack List System** to guide consignors through the process of preparing and shipping their items. This system streamlined the consignment journey, improving efficiency, accountability, and consignor satisfaction.

### Key Features and Implementation

#### 1. **Dynamic Pack List Generation**

* **Customizable Pack Lists:**

  * Generated specific to each consignor based on their submitted items and account history.
* **Required Fields:**

  * Included fields for brand, item description, condition, and any supporting documentation.
* **Packing Instructions:**

  * Provided tailored guidance to ensure items were packaged securely for transit.

#### 2. **Digital Integration**

* **Pre-Shipment Form:**

  * Consignors filled out a digital form listing the items they planned to send, which generated the pack list.
* **QR Code for Tracking:**

  * Included a scannable QR code on the pack list to link shipments directly to consignor accounts, ensuring seamless intake and processing.

#### 3. **Real-Time Accountability**

* **Item Verification:**

  * The pack list was cross-checked with the items received at our facilities, reducing disputes and improving accuracy.
* **Status Updates:**

  * Consignors received real-time updates on their shipment’s progress, from receipt to authentication.

#### Results

1. **Reduced Processing Delays**:

   * Complete and accurate information from consignors accelerated intake and authentication processes.
2. **Improved Item Safety**:

   * Clear packing instructions minimized transit damage, ensuring items arrived in optimal condition.
3. **Increased Consignor Satisfaction**:

   * A streamlined and transparent process encouraged consignors to list more items, boosting supply growth.
4. **Enhanced Accountability**:

   * Digital tracking and verification reduced disputes over shipments, improving trust between consignors and The RealReal.

#### Why It Matters

The Dynamic Pack List System simplified the consignment process, addressing key pain points for consignors while improving operational efficiency. By ensuring items arrived safely and with complete information, we:

* Reduced delays and processing times, creating a better experience for consignors.
* Increased trust and transparency, driving higher consignor retention and supply growth.
