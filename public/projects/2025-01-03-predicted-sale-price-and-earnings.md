#### The Problem

The RealReal’s unique consignment model offered a full-service experience: consignors sent in items, which we authenticated, photographed, and listed for sale. While this approach eliminated much of the hassle for consignors, it also created significant gaps in transparency and expectations:

1. **Lack of Visibility**:

   * Consignors had no insight into when their items would sell or why pricing adjustments were made.
   * This uncertainty deterred some consignors from listing and led others to prematurely request items back, causing operational inefficiencies.
2. **Rising Costs from Returned Items**:

   * When consignors disagreed with pricing, they often requested items be shipped back to them.
   * Shipping costs for returns escalated, with no opportunity to recoup costs since the items were no longer for sale.
3. **Missed Opportunity for More Consignments**:

   * The lack of upfront transparency about potential earnings discouraged consignors from sending additional items, limiting supply growth.

#### The Solution

To address these issues, we developed a machine learning (ML) model to predict:

1. **When an Item Would Sell:**

   * Providing consignors with estimated timelines based on historical and current marketplace trends.
2. **For How Much:**

   * Offering predicted sale prices and potential earnings upfront to help consignors make informed decisions.
3. **Transparency to Build Trust:**

   * Surfacing examples of similar items and their historical performance to validate the model’s predictions and establish credibility.

### Key Features and Implementation

#### 1. **Machine Learning Predictions**

* **Inputs to the Model:**

  * Global historical data on item performance.
  * Recent trends in search and sales.
  * Item-specific attributes such as brand, condition, and rarity.
* **Refinement Through Consignor Input:**

  * Since item attributes (e.g., condition) were determined after items were received, we introduced a pre-submission form for consignors to provide their perspective on these dimensions.
  * This enabled more accurate predictions and set clearer expectations upfront.

#### 2. **Estimated Sale Timeline and Earnings**

* Delivered predicted sale timelines and earnings directly to consignors during the pre-submission process.
* Highlighted variability based on factors like brand, condition, and demand trends to help consignors understand potential outcomes.

#### 3. **Proof Through Transparency**

* Surfaced comparable items that had already sold, showing:

  * Sale price.
  * Time to sell.
  * Relevant attributes such as brand, condition, and category.
* This feature reassured consignors that predictions were data-driven, not arbitrary.

### Results

1. **Increased Consignor Trust and Retention**:

   * Providing clarity about potential earnings and timelines reduced consignor frustration and improved retention rates.
2. **Higher Consignment Volume**:

   * Transparency about potential earnings encouraged consignors to list more items, driving supply growth.
3. **Reduced Shipping Costs**:

   * Fewer consignors requested items back due to disagreement over pricing, significantly lowering return shipping expenses.
4. **Improved Customer Experience**:

   * Consignors appreciated the upfront transparency and felt more confident about the platform’s process.

#### Why It Matters

This initiative addressed long-standing gaps in consignor trust and supply growth. By predicting sale prices and timelines with data-driven transparency, we:

* Aligned consignor expectations with marketplace realities, fostering stronger relationships.
* Reduced operational inefficiencies and costs associated with returns.
* Strengthened The RealReal’s position as a trusted, transparent, and efficient platform for luxury resale.

Ultimately, this innovation not only improved supply growth but also reinforced The RealReal’s reputation for fairness and credibility in the highly competitive consignment market.
