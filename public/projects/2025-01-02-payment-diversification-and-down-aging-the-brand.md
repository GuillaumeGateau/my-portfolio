#### The Problem

Macy’s credit card and loyalty programs were critical drivers of revenue and profit, offering significant margins from transactions made both within and outside Macy’s. However, acquisition and activation rates were disproportionately higher in-store than online. In stores, customers often signed up for the credit card at the register due to the direct engagement of employees incentivized to pitch the benefits. In contrast, the digital experience lacked clear, compelling decision points and failed to communicate the tangible value of these programs effectively.

This created gaps in:

* **Acquisition**: Online sign-ups were significantly lower due to a lack of clear prompts and tangible benefits.
* **Activation**: Customers who signed up online often failed to use the card or engage with the program.
* **Retention**: The programs’ long-term benefits weren’t effectively messaged, resulting in missed opportunities to drive repeat purchases and loyalty.

#### The Solution

To address these challenges, I led an initiative focused on optimizing the digital experience for Macy’s credit card and rewards programs. This included designing strategies to drive acquisition, activation, and retention through behavioral economics, data-driven personalization, and improved value communication.

### Acquisition: Making the Value Clear and Immediate

The first step was addressing why online acquisition lagged behind in-store sign-ups. A major factor was the absence of a clear, binary decision node akin to the in-store register experience. To replicate this digitally, we integrated value-driven messaging throughout the shopping journey:

1. **Dynamic Savings Messaging**

   * On every product detail page (PDP), we displayed how much customers would save on their purchase if they signed up for the credit card. This personalized calculation grew as customers added more items to their cart, reinforcing the tangible benefit of immediate savings.
2. **Session-Wide Incentives**

   * As customers browsed, the cumulative potential savings of signing up were prominently displayed in their cart and at checkout. This created a sense of urgency and value, driving higher sign-up rates.
3. **Targeted Promotions**

   * Highlighted exclusive credit card offers, such as category-specific deals (e.g., mattresses) or discounts tied to high-demand events, making the value of the card feel unique and actionable.

### Activation: Driving Engagement Early

One of the biggest challenges online was ensuring customers activated their credit card after signing up. To address this, we:

1. **In-Session Activation Prompts**

   * Encouraged immediate card use by showing customers how much they would save on their current purchase if they used their Macy’s credit card.
2. **First Purchase Offers**

   * Enhanced the first-purchase experience by providing additional discounts or rewards for using the card immediately, creating a strong incentive to activate.
3. **Loyalty Program Enrollment**

   * Automatically enrolled credit card users into the loyalty program, ensuring they were immediately eligible for points, exclusive offers, and other benefits.

### Retention: Reinforcing Loyalty Over Time

With acquisition and activation optimized, we turned to retention by building sustained engagement through tailored messaging and benefits:

1. **Personalized Rewards Messaging**

   * Used CRM and retargeting to highlight the customer’s rewards balance, potential earnings on items they viewed, and exclusive offers tailored to their preferences.
   * Employed strike-through pricing and clear savings visuals to emphasize the ongoing value of using the credit card.
2. **Dynamic Offer Targeting**

   * Prominently displayed offers and rewards eligibility on PDPs and across the shopping journey, ensuring that customers always understood the value they were earning.
3. **Non-Credit Loyalty Sign-Ups**

   * Pre-checked the option to join the loyalty program for customers not signing up for the credit card. This approach, combined with enhanced messaging about the program’s benefits, increased loyalty enrollment fivefold. Importantly, these customers showed improved return rates and usage of loyalty offers, driving incremental revenue.

### Results and Impact

* **5X Growth in Loyalty Program Sign-Ups**: The pre-checked box combined with value-driven messaging drove a massive increase in loyalty enrollment without sacrificing quality.
* **Significant Uptick in Credit Card Sign-Ups**: Dynamic PDP and cart messaging improved acquisition rates substantially, bridging the gap between in-store and online performance.
* **Higher Retention and Engagement**: Customers responded strongly to personalized messaging and rewards visibility, resulting in increased return visits and purchases.
* **Improved CRM ROI**: Retargeting efforts became more effective due to tailored, value-driven communication, enhancing overall program profitability.

### Why It Matters

This initiative demonstrated the power of combining behavioral economics with data-driven insights to influence customer behavior. By making the value of Macy’s credit card and loyalty programs tangible at every stage of the customer journey, we not only increased sign-ups but also drove sustained engagement and profitability. This work underscored the importance of integrating acquisition, activation, and retention strategies into a cohesive ecosystem that benefits both the customer and the business.
