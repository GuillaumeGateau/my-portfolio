#### The Problem

Fraud and chargebacks posed significant operational and financial challenges for Macy’s. Internal systems were outdated, resource-intensive, and heavily reliant on large teams to manually handle chargebacks and security issues. During the pandemic, talent attrition further weakened these capabilities, increasing the risks and costs associated with fraud.

Chargebacks threatened Macy’s relationship with credit card networks like Visa. Elevated chargeback rates could lead to higher transaction fees and, at worst, potential suspension from these networks. This operational inefficiency, combined with the growing sophistication of fraud, underscored the need for a modernized solution that could handle these issues at scale without compromising customer trust.

#### The Solution

To address these challenges, I led a cross-functional initiative to evaluate and integrate Riskified, a leading fraud prevention provider. Riskified offered a hybrid buy-and-integrate solution that combined their proprietary fraud detection technology with Macy’s internal systems to create a seamless fraud prevention ecosystem.

Riskified’s model provided significant advantages:

1. **Chargeback Guarantee**: Riskified absorbed the financial liability for chargebacks on approved transactions, reducing Macy’s exposure and ensuring predictable costs.
2. **Dynamic Fraud Detection**: Their machine learning algorithms analyzed customer behavior in real-time to accurately flag fraudulent transactions without introducing unnecessary friction.
3. **Step-Up Authentication**: For borderline cases, step-up authentication was integrated to confirm legitimacy while maintaining a positive customer experience.

#### Key Integration Efforts

The integration was extensive, requiring collaboration across Macy’s entire technical stack and operational workflows. Key areas of focus included:

1. **Front-End Integration**

   * Enabled customer behavior tracking and fraud signals to flow seamlessly into Riskified’s system.
   * Updated the payment flow to incorporate post-transaction fraud checks, reducing false positives that had previously driven cart abandonment.
   * Implemented step-up authentication directly into the customer experience for flagged transactions, ensuring legitimate customers could still complete their purchases.
2. **Back-End Infrastructure**

   * Replaced legacy fraud detection processes with Riskified’s APIs.
   * Rebuilt workflows to ensure flagged products could be returned to inventory without showing as unavailable, minimizing the impact on operational efficiency.
   * Improved data storage and flow to maintain compliance with PCI standards while supporting advanced fraud detection capabilities.
3. **Business Processes**

   * Worked with supply chain and inventory teams to handle product recovery when transactions were flagged as fraudulent post-purchase.
   * Updated reporting systems to incorporate insights from Riskified, giving the business real-time visibility into fraud trends and approval rates.
4. **Customer Trust and Security**

   * Reduced incidents of customers receiving fraudulent charges, reinforcing trust in the brand.
   * Improved communication with customers by integrating clear messaging about additional security steps, ensuring transparency.

#### Results

* **Substantial Reduction in Chargebacks**: Riskified’s system decreased fraudulent chargebacks significantly, bringing Macy’s chargeback rate well below network thresholds.
* **Lower Fees**: Reduced chargeback rates improved Macy’s standing with credit card networks, lowering transaction fees and increasing profitability.
* **Improved Customer Experience**: Step-up authentication ensured legitimate customers could complete purchases without friction, maintaining high satisfaction rates.
* **Operational Efficiency Gains**: Automated fraud detection reduced the workload for internal teams, freeing up resources for other critical initiatives.
* **Reduced Lost Product**: The system prevented fraudulent transactions from resulting in shipped goods, minimizing inventory losses and ensuring products remained available for legitimate customers.

#### Why It Matters

This initiative fundamentally transformed Macy’s approach to fraud prevention, creating a scalable, efficient system that not only protected the bottom line but also improved customer trust and satisfaction. By integrating Riskified with existing systems, we turned a costly, high-risk area into a streamlined operation that supported long-term growth and profitability. This project highlighted the importance of leveraging external expertise while ensuring the solution was deeply embedded into our ecosystem, touching every aspect from front-end experience to back-office workflows.
