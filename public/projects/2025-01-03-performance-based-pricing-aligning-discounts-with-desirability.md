#### The Problem

The RealReal’s pricing strategy operated independently of customer behavior metrics. Items were discounted after a fixed time on site (e.g., 10 days), regardless of their actual desirability or performance. This rigid approach caused several issues:

1. **Late Discounts**:

   * Desirable items that failed to sell quickly remained at their original price far longer than necessary, leading to missed opportunities to encourage sales earlier.
2. **Inefficient Re-Ranking**:

   * Price changes were not reflected in search rankings, meaning discounted items remained buried and failed to gain new visibility.
3. **Customer Exploitation of Patterns**:

   * Customers exploited the predictable discount schedule, waiting for items to hit the 10-day mark before purchasing.
4. **Supplier Frustration**:

   * Consignors were frustrated by unexplained price drops and slow sales, eroding trust in the platform.

#### The Solution

Using insights from the Desirability Index developed for search optimization, we overhauled the pricing strategy to create a performance-based system that dynamically adjusted prices and re-ranked items accordingly.

### Key Features and Changes

#### 1. **Dynamic Discounts**

Pricing was tied to desirability metrics rather than time on site:

* Items with low desirability (e.g., low click-through rates, low favorites) were discounted earlier to encourage sales.
* Items with high desirability maintained their original price longer, maximizing revenue potential.

#### 2. **Reintroduction of Discounted Items**

Discounted items were treated as "new" and re-ranked in search results to reflect their updated value:

* Reintroduction increased visibility for discounted items, leading to faster sales.
* This avoided the previous issue where discounted items remained buried in search results.

#### 3. **Transparency for Consignors**

We provided consignors with detailed reports on item performance, including:

* Views and impressions.
* Click-through rates and favorites.
* The rationale behind price adjustments.

#### Results

1. **Higher Average Sale Prices**:

   * Items sold earlier in their lifecycle, reducing the need for steep discounts.
2. **Faster Inventory Turnover**:

   * Items sold more quickly due to dynamic pricing and improved visibility after price changes.
3. **Improved Customer Experience**:

   * Customers benefited from more relevant pricing and fewer predictable patterns, increasing urgency and scarcity.
4. **Increased Consignor Retention**:

   * Transparent pricing adjustments improved consignor trust and encouraged repeat listings.

#### Why It Matters

Redesigning The RealReal’s pricing strategy aligned discounts and visibility with item performance, creating a system that benefited all stakeholders. This approach:

* Ensured items sold at stronger price points earlier in their lifecycle, maximizing revenue potential.
* Addressed consignor frustrations by introducing transparent and fair pricing adjustments.
* Reduced predictable discounting patterns, increasing urgency and scarcity for customers.
* Improved the overall marketplace ecosystem by driving faster turnover and greater profitability.
